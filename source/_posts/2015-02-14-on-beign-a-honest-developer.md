I spent a god part of my life traveling from town to town, first  i was born in tetouan in a small vilage and then moved to Safi with my family mom and brother & dad stayed in tetouan then when my sister came we moved to casa, stil without my dad that visted us regulary but due to his work he couldn't be with us. when first we came up here to casa i was living in a vilage in my grand father farm without electricity for 2 years that was a huge mind shift for me because i here i learn a lot of thing since there were no TV or any kind f distraction so i was reading all the time. Then after those 2 years we moved to an apartment and my dad moved to live with us we, here i lived what we can name the rebellion age i was skipping school and to resume i was a big looser. Until the 2 year of bac where suddenly i wanted to change, and i'm very grateful to God for this one. so things started to be great for me i become what sociality call a Great student; but then i moved to a new level i wanted to find a passion, something to leave for, i was living a identity crisis (with some break-ups along the way which make things worst) but what i've done was keep searching for that thing, i knew there was something. One day while i was chatting with my teacher he said jocking : "you know what's dangerous for us as humans ?". "No" i said. so he responded "Rotin work !" then i asked curiously "ther's any work without rotin", then he responded with the most beautiful sentences in the world, "Programming !!".
hhh well you know what happed next hhhh i decided that this thing is my thing and i said to : "Motaquillah you love art ! you love electronics !! you love problems solving ! well here you go !!" and rest is history !!!! hhh
