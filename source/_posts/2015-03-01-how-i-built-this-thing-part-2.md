>When I go to the sea I always go as a simple sailor and never as a passenger. Why should I pay when I can get paid for my work?

That was **Ishmael** from **Moby dick**, This quote always comes to my mind when I thought of creating my own blog using Platforms like Wordpress or something similar, instead of using a Static site generator (SSG).

I'm a developer with technical background, who wants to start blogging and I don't want something to hide the technical details behind some sort of UIs that do things that I'm familiar with, I'm a sailor so why should I be a passenger and pay with my time to learn another way to do things that I already know.

In [the first part](#) of this series I talked about the inspiration and how I created the design of this blog, in this second Part I'll talk about how I used [Sculpin]() to implement this blog and gulp to automatize some recurrent tasks. Unlike the first part this entry will guide you through the process of creating your own blog using the described tools, by showing you how I built mine.

Without any further introductions let's start!
